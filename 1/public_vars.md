# Chapter 9: Public Variables

Storage variables can be marked as `public` during declaration:

```vyper
publicName: public(String[64])
```

The compiler automatically creates getter functions for all `public` storage variables. These getter functions are NOT written in your code, but are generated by the compiler when it compiles it.

For the example above, the compiler will generate a function named `publicName` that does not take any arguments and returns a `String[64]`, the value of the state variable `publicName`. So, even if you cannot see any function named `publicName`, it will be generated when your code is compiled.

## Put it to the test

We need a public storage variable that tracks the number of pokemons created in the contract.

1. Create a `public` storage variable named `totalPokemonCount` of type `uint256`.
2. Replace the key `0` in the mapping `pokemonList` in the function `_createPokemon` with
   the storage variable `totalPokemonCount`. Remember to use the `self` environment variable to access the storage variable from the function.
3. In the `_createPokemon` function, increment `totalPokemonCount` by 1 using the `self` environment variable. To make the code look clean use the `+=` arithmetic operator as shown below:

   ```vyper
   # adds 1 to the parameter passed
   @external
   def addOne(number: uint256):
      # we used += to increment number by 1
      number += 1
   ```
