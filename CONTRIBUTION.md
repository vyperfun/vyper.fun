![Vyper.fun: Link to Spanish translation](https://files.gitter.im/5f4e9bc8d73408ce4fedc7e3/fegp/hack-1.png)

Let's suppose you want to translate [Chapter 1: Contracts](). First, **ADD A COMMENT in issue page, specifying the Lesson and chapter number**. In this case, you will comment "Lesson 1, Chapter 1". You can also add multiple chapters in a single comment.

**To win a Hacktoberfest T-Shirt, you need to complete and submit 4 chapters by 31st of October, 2020.**

**IF YOU SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST WITHOUT COMMENTING ON THE ISSUE, YOUR PULL REQUEST WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.**

### Step 3: Edit a file to add your translation

Now, click the link corresponding to the chapter. You will see the following page:

![Vyper.fun: Lesson 1: Chapter 1: Contracts](https://files.gitter.im/5f4e9bc8d73408ce4fedc7e3/cS3H/hack-2.png)

Click the "pencil" icon on the top right to edit the file.

![Pencil icon can be used to edit a file](https://files.gitter.im/5f4e9bc8d73408ce4fedc7e3/S901/hack-3.png)

In the first line of the file, you will find a link. In this case you will find the following link: https://vyper.fun/#/1/contract_structure

![Post link in the file comment](https://files.gitter.im/5f4e9bc8d73408ce4fedc7e3/wwcQ/hack-4.png)

If you open the link, you will find the content that you need to translate.
